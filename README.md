# dwk++
A small code to get delta W_k
This c++ code can be used to Calculate delta_W_k in tokamak plasma by 3D integration (r,Lambda,E).
We use a slowing down distribution function for fast ions and a kink like mode structure.
By assuming the fishbone dispersion relation,  it can find out the Eigenvalues(mode frequency) and beta_c correspoinding to the input growth rate with a mode structure input.
